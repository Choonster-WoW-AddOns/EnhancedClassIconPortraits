**EnhancedClassIconPortraits** is a WoW AddOn that replaces the portraits of the default unit frames with class icons.

Inspired by AddOns like [ClassIconNotPortrait](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/classiconnotportrait) and [sfClassIconPortraits](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info23852-sfClassIconPortraits.html). Code adapted from [ClassIconNotPortrait](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/classiconnotportrait).

You can download the AddOn from [CurseForge](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/enhancedclassiconportraits) or [WoW Interface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25035-EnhancedClassIconPortraits.html).

You can find the latest alpha versions on [CurseForge](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/enhancedclassiconportraits) and the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Choonster-WoW-AddOns/EnhancedClassIconPortraits).
