**EnhancedClassIconPortraits** is a WoW AddOn that replaces the portraits of the default unit frames with class icons.

Inspired by AddOns like [ClassIconNotPortrait](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/classiconnotportrait) and [sfClassIconPortraits](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info23852-sfClassIconPortraits.html). Code adapted from [ClassIconNotPortrait](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/classiconnotportrait).

Thanks [OligoFriends](https://www.wowinterface.com/forums/member.php?u=249441) for the original concept and the art design.
